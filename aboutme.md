My name is Chris Patrick, I'm a data scientist and statistician. I am interested in builing tools/products for decision making under uncertainty. 

### A little bit more

I am from the Indianpolis, IN area and studied at Purdue University. Outside of work I enjoy golf, sports, markets and am always learning.

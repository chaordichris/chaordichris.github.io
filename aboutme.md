My name is Chris. I am interested all things complex, dynamic, emergent, and non-linear. I love learning about technology, finance, math, food, agriculture....just about anything really....through the dynamic lense. The name of this site is an ode to Dee Hock and his concept, "chaordic", described on his [site](http://www.deewhock.com/) as follows:

> chaordic [kay-ord π-ic], adj., fr. E. chaos and order.  1. The behavior of any self-organizing, self-governing, organ, organization, or system that harmoniously exhibits characteristics of both order and chaos.   2.  Patterned by chaos and order in a way not dominated by either.  3.  Blending of diversity, chaos, complexity and order characteristic of the fundamental organizing principles of evolution and nature.

I am a native of Indiana and studied at [Purdue University](purdue.edu).

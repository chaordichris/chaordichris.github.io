> [Renassaince man](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Renaissance%20man#:~:text=%3A%20a%20person%20who%20has%20wide%20interests%20and%20is%20expert%20in%20several%20areas)
": a person who has wide interests and is expert in several areas."

<!-- I will paraphrase Dee Hock, "it is becoming easier and easier for a single person to provide a unique product or service to another person anywhere throughout the world, at any time."

In the information age it is possible for (almost) anyone, at (almost) any time to learn a new skill and thus provide a new service or product. Thus, the business landscape will become the most competitive in history. 

Simultaneouslyy, a product or service can be marketed to (almost) anyone, (almost) anywhere in the world. Thus, the business landscape will be the most inviting for entrepreneurship in the history of the world. 

I believe a few factors will define success in this environment:
* Execution is an edge:
- When information is freely available to everyone, the edge migrates to the "doers". When anyone can learn to do something for themselves, those who do it best are providing value. This is as simple as "practice makes perfect". 
* Embrace you uniqueness:
- In a connected world, there are virtually infinite niche markets to take advantage of. There is a high probability that your unique skills and interests will cater to some of them. These are opportunities where value can be derived.
* Stay nimble
- As information is flowing freely, markets are smaller scale, and barriers to entry are small, products and services will quickly be replaced with new ones. Stay innovative within your market and stay open to pursuing new and different ideas as change inevitably arrives. 

Those who embrace these concepts as entrepeneurs will live a full life in the information age. The modern rennassaince man may freely pursue their unique interests and abilities, and may create products or offer services related to them when the opportunity presents itself.  -->

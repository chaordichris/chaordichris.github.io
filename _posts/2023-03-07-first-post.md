[Renassaince man](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Renaissance%20man#:~:text=%3A%20a%20person%20who%20has%20wide%20interests%20and%20is%20expert%20in%20several%20areas)
        ": a person who has wide interests and is expert in several areas."

I will paraphrase Dee Hock, "it is becoming easier and easier for a single person to provide a unique product or service to another person anywhere throughout the world, at any time."
